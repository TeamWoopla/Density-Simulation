# Density-Simulation
We have decided we wanted to start a big project that will advance our portfolio while still being fun to make. So we sat down and thought. After a couple hours of brainstorming we have decided to embark on a physics projects saga. After filling up a "project ideas" list we started. We've decided to go from least difficult to most difficult so the first "easiest" project that was in there was a Density simulation, you get a playgound that's filled with water and you can drop object and see if they drown or if they float. if you want to download this project and mess around with it, Github link is down below. Have fun!
