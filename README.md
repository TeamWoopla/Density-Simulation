instructions:
1) if you don't already have python installed, install it here - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/
2) *only if you don't have python* open the link i provided below, scroll down and choose your os and the type of installation. My recommendations are for Mac - just choose the one that says your os version and Windows - Windows x86-64 executable installer
3) after you have python, install the Simulation.py file and enjoy :)
